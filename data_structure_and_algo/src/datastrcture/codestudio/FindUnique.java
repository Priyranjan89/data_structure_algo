Problem Statement

Sample Input 1:>
1
7
2 3 1 6 3 6 2
Sample Output 1:>
1
Explanation: The array is [2, 3, 1, 6, 3, 6, 2]. Here, the numbers 2, 3, and 6 are present twice, and the number 1 is present only once. So, the unique number in this array is 1.
Sample Input 2:>
2
5
2 4 7 2 7
9
1 3 1 3 6 6 7 10 7
Sample Output 2:>
4
Explanation: In the first test case, the array is [2, 4, 7, 2, 7]. Here, the numbers 2 and 7 are present twice, and the number 4 is present only once. So, the unique number in this array is 4.

10
Explanation: In the second test case, the array is [1, 3, 1, 3, 6, 6, 7, 10, 7]. Here, the numbers 1, 3, 6, and 7 are present twice, and the number 10 is present only once. So, the unique number in this array is 10.
